# **Connect Wallet using Wallet Connect**

> [!Note]
Remember that you will need to connect to the governance web app with your **SAFE** & choose **Ethereum Sepolia Testnet** as the network for all your interactions.

For connecting to the governance web app with your SAFE, use WalletConnect integration:

If you are using a **mobile wallet you can scan the QR code to continue.** 

Otherwise, **you can open the full wallet connect popup to get the connection URL:**

Once you have copied that link, you can use it inside your safe to connect with the governance web app:
